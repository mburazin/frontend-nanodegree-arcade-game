# Frogger game clone
This project features a classic arcade game clone (Frogger) that was developed as part of the **Udacity Frontend Nanodegree** course.

## How to run the game
Just open up `index.html` in your favorite browser and the game starts automatically. If you want to start the game from the beginning, refresh the page (F5).
Turn on your speakers for sound effects.
You can also run the game by accessing the following link: https://mburazin.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

## How to play

You control the movement of the player character by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The object is to earn as many points as possible before losing all of your lives.
The most points (10) you can earn by reaching the water, which also resets player's position. You can also earn 1, 2 or 3 points each time you pick up gems which appear randomly on the street.
